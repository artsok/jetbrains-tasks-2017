### Intro
I found [tasks] from that GitHub page and had the interest to resolve while stayed home with COVID-19.

I know that it's not the best solutions in my code :) But you can help me to improve it

### Tasks
1. Find the last 10 digits of the sum of the sequence 1^1 + 2^2 + 3^3 + ... + 1000^1000?: 
2. What is the index of the first member of the Fibonacci series, which has 1000 digits in decimal notation?: 
3. Find the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of the number 100!?:
4. What is the sum of the digits in the decimal notation of 2 ^ 1000?:
5. Find the number and it max sequence length 

### Run app
Run gradle to get the answer for the tasks 1-5.
```
gradle run
```

### Commentaries

Task #5 could be improved by using storage for already found sequences.
